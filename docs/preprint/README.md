# Paper

- The files `paper.md` and `paper.bib` were meant for the JOSS submission, see
  https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/7879.
- The files `paper.tex`, `paper.pdf`, and `ealogo.png` are the translation of
  the Joss submission to a simple LaTeX file for submission to EarthArXiv.
